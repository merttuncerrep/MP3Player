# MP3Player
Design an MP3 Player Software Architecture
Objective:
Design the architecture and class/method structures for a mock MP3 player application. Focus on outlining the solution with diagrams and stubbed-out code. Full implementation is not required for this take-home exercise.
 
Scenario:
You are tasked with designing a lightweight MP3 player application that will display and play songs from a predefined dataset of albums. The application should be designed as either:
A Command-Line Interface (CLI), or
A Web Application.
 
Requirements:
Core Features to Design For:
Display a list of albums and their songs.
Select and play a song.
Provide playback controls: play, pause, stop, next, and previous.
Display the currently playing song and its duration.
Design Deliverables:
Architecture Diagram: A high-level diagram showing the main components, their responsibilities, and interactions.
Class/Method Structures: Define the classes/modules you would use, including key methods and attributes.
Example: class Album { name, artist, songs[] } or function playSong(songId).
Stubbed-Out Code: Write skeleton code for the most important parts of the application to show how your design would be translated into code. Full implementation is not required.
Example: A Player class with methods like play, pause, stop and comments indicating the intended functionality.
Assumptions:
Document any assumptions about the application (e.g., how data is stored or accessed).
Specify which platform (CLI or web) you are designing for.
Optional Features (Bonus Points):
Support shuffle and repeat functionality.
Add search functionality by artist, album, or song name.
 
Deliverables:
Architecture Design:
A diagram (can be hand-drawn and scanned or created with a tool like Lucidchart, draw.io, or similar).
Brief descriptions of each component and their responsibilities.
Stubbed-Out Code:
Provide skeleton code files for the core components/classes in your preferred language.
Add comments or docstrings to explain your design choices.
Documentation:
Include a brief explanation of your design and why you chose it.
 
Expected Time Commitment:
This assignment is designed to take approximately 2 hours. Focus on clarity and design rather than implementation.
 
Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity of Design:
Is the architecture well-structured and easy to understand?
Completeness:
Are the diagrams and stubs detailed enough to demonstrate the candidateâ€™s understanding of the problem?
Scalability and Flexibility:
Does the design consider future expansion (e.g., adding features like playlists or streaming)?
Code Quality:
Are the stubbed-out classes and methods logically structured and documented?
